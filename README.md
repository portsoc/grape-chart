# Grape Chart Generator

Grape charts were conceived by Dr Hartmut Blank (University of Portsmouth).

This tool is an off-shoot from https://github.com/jacekkopecky/living-meta-analysis
created by Dr Jacek Kopecky (University of Portsmouth) based on the React.js code by Ronan McCarthy.

The tool is live at https://portsoc.github.io/grape-chart
